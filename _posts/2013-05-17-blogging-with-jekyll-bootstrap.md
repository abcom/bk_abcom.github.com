Finally, I have decided to use Jekyll for my personal blog on Information Security and have chosen [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), thinking I would spent less effort for design/ configuration tweaks ;). 

To be honest, I didn't like any of the ready-made Jekyll-Bootstrap themes (no offense if you are using one), so I have found [Bootswatch theme](https://github.com/geevi/theme-bootswatch) and tweaked it a bit. 

Well, it took me a day to setup everything, configuring and rewriting some parts of the code for my design needs. I didn't have any previous CSS or Rails experience before setting up this blog, so I guess it's a reasonable and useful time to spend? Let me know if you need help with Jekyll blog.
