Finally, I have decided to use Jekyll for my personal blog on Information Security and have chosen [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), thinking I would spent less effort for design/ configuration tweaks ;). 

To be honest, I didn't like any of ready-made the Jekyll-Bootstrap themes, so this blog is based on [Bootswatch theme](https://github.com/geevi/theme-bootswatch).
